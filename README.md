# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) event.

## Goal
My goal for AoC 2025 is to solve each day's puzzles using a different programming language. \
Note that from selected languages the only one I've used before for actual programming is C and Assembly (not NASM syntax though) and the only language that I actually feel comfortable with is C. \
All other languages I will be using for the first time or my experience with them is limited to seeing some code snippets online. \
The code quality will likely be poor for most languages as I want to finish puzzles the same day they are released and there will be little or no optimization or refactoring. \
It's possible that for some languages I will be using LLMs, but NEVER for coming up with a solution. \
Basically I want to have fun with new languages.

- task2: 0,00s user 0,00s system 38% cpu 0,001 total

### Day 2 - Rust \[DONE\]

- task1: 0,05s user 0,00s system 96% cpu 0,058 total
- task2: 0,13s user 0,00s system 96% cpu 0,141 total

### Day 3 - Go \[DONE\]

- task1: 0,00s user 0,00s system 66% cpu 0,002 total
- task2: 0,00s user 0,00s system 84% cpu 0,002 total

### Day 4 - Linux x86-64 NASM Assembly - instead of Zig \[DONE\]

## Thoughts
### C
I love C.

### Rust
Better than expected. Felt very intuitive for simple tasks.

### Zig
Unusable. Even reading a file feels like black magic.

### Go
Exquisite. For the first time using it, it was very intuitive and productive.

### Linux x86-64 NASM Assembly
After a workday and writing this I am too tired to think. Still easier to read from file than with Zig.

### D
Better C++?

### Kotlin
I hate use of var and val keywords and the fact that you can't do reverse for loops with eg. for (i in 100..0).

### Haskell
It's interesting. Unfortunately I was drinking when programming, which in most languages is not a problem, but in this case happened to be one. I came up with a good solution for task 2, made a programming error and went down a spiral of overthinking the puzzle. Long story short, Haskell feels ok, but not for a one day challange. Couldn't do it without slight help from Gemini.
